<h2><center>Abstract</center></h2>
<center><p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disease that interferes with memory and normal brain function and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.  The key to combating thisdisease is early detection. This project applies Machine Learning algorithms on a dataset with 6400 MRI brain scans to train highly accurate models to predict the stage of the disease. These models can help detect early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and set patients on a path to recovery, which can help combat this widespread problem</p></center><br>
